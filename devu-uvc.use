Supported devices:
    All UVC 1.0/1.1/1.5 compatible devices.

Options:
    -v   Increase verbosity:
             -v usb insert/removal events.
             -vv the same as -v, but with class specific descriptors.
             -vvv the same as -vv, but with devctl trace.
             -vvvv the same as -vvv, but with usb transfer trace.

    -l   List compiled-in libraries and exit.

    -e   Disable pixel format emulation, driver currently supports:
             YUY2->UYVY conversion,
             YUY2->VYUY conversion,
             YUY2->YVYU conversion.
         These formats are not intersect with libv4l2 and libv4lconvert
         format emulation.

    -a   Do not register USB audio capture driver. By default driver
         registers USB audio capture interface, which belongs to UVC
         camera, in io-audio service. If system already has USB audio
         driver up and running, this option must be set.
